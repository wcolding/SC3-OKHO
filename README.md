# SC3-OKHO
One Hit KO Mod for Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory

This is a dll inject/asi mod for Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. It makes Sam die at any amount of damage taken, as an extra challenge. Please note coop mode is not currently supported.

## Usage
Either inject the dll manually into the running game or use the asi file with something like the [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases). If you are already using the Widescreen Fix you can just put it in your existing scripts folder. Otherwise, create a scripts folder in the `System` directory and place the asi file in there.
